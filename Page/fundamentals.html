          Here we will explain the first steps in FUDGE and how everything is
          set up to help you get started with the engine, if there are any
          questions after the tutorial, don&#39;t hesitate to post an issue or
          call for help in Discord in the game lab.

        <p>
          To start a new project in FUDGE, go to Project - New , and select the
          folder of your choice. The editor will create all the data you need
          for your project there, as well as make any changes you have made to
          the project.
        </p>

          alt="BildEditorAufbauExampleScaled"
        />
        <p>
          Once the project is created, you can now open the tabs for editing the
          project. In the Project tab you can create new projects, load existing
          ones and save your current one. In the Edit tab you can see all the
          tabs you can use for your work. These tabs can be closed and opened as
          you like, as well as moved around in the window as you like. This
          allows you to customize your working environment. In the debug tab you
          can open the browser console in case you accidentally closed it or
          show the window in full screen.

          alt="BildLinkTheme"
        />
        <p>
          It is good to know that you can change the theme of the editor as you
          like or even design one yourself. Go to HTML - Fudge.html and comment
          the desired theme or create a new stylesheet and include it there.
        </p>

          <span style="color: red; font-size: 1.8rem">Important!</span> In order
          to detect and monitor errors at an early stage, it is advisable to
          always have the browser console open in the editor as well as in the
          Internet browser. You can also expand the messages of Fudge by
          expanding the messages in the browser console.

        <p>
          Since the project is stored locally in your folder, you can also view
          them in Explorer. This is where all the resources you need for your
          project are created and stored.
        </p>
        <div class="FloatClearer"></div>

        <p>
          Here you can also add your own images, graphics, models that you may
          need for your project. It is best to create a new folder for external
          data to keep the overview.
        </p>
        <h2 id="create-graph">Create Graph</h2>
        <p>

          />
        </p>
        <p>
          The project has been created, but there is no content to view it yet.
          If you want to view your project right now, the internet browser will
          give you the following error message:
        </p>
        <div class="FloatClearer"></div>

        <p>
          <img
            src="https://github.com/JirkaDellOro/FudgeTutorial/assets/101626054/21f603d5-7e23-425a-b4ca-bd2e81428587"
            alt="BildAblaufCreateMesh"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, to see something on the browser, we need to add a graph, mesh and
          material to the project. To do this, right-click on Internal in the
          editor and follow the steps on the following image:
        </p>
        <div class="FloatClearer"></div>

        <h2 id="test-the-project-in-the-browser">
          Test the project in the browser
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you want to test the project live in the browser or test it on
          other devices, you can do this via
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>LiveServer plugin, which VSC provides.</li>
          <li>localhost</li>
          <li>GitHub Pages, where you upload your project to GitHub.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="json-overview">JSON Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <img

            alt="BildAufbauJSON"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          If you look at the internal.json file on your development environment,
          you will see all the resources that FUDGE has created over the course
          of the project, what attributes they have, and how they relate to each
          other. Here you can see the graph, mesh and material you created in
          the previous step.
        </p>

        <div class="FloatClearer"></div>
        <pre><code class="language-json"></code>Internal.json
            // insert internal-json here
          </pre>

        <p>
          For now, the resources are just there. Throughout the tutorial, the
          file will change and expand as we add new objects and connect existing
          ones.
        </p>
        <h2 id="build-a-graph">Build a graph</h2>
        <p>
          <img

            alt="BildCreateNodeScaled"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          To view the created resources in the browser, they must first be
          attached to a node. For this, a node must be created in the editor. If
          you drag the graph into the editor, it will create a node itself.
        </p>
        <div class="FloatClearer"></div>

        <p>
          <img
            src="https://github.com/JirkaDellOro/FudgeTutorial/assets/101626054/51a230f3-abb2-43e1-b141-0de3e7726858"
            alt="BildAppendResources"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          For the remaining components, you have to create a node yourself and
          attach the resources. This can be done by drag&amp;drop. First the
          mesh, then the material. Alternatively, you can create the components
          by right-clicking - add Component - ComponentMesh/ComponentMaterial
          and then attach the desired resources from the Internal tab.
        </p>
        <div class="FloatClearer"></div>

        <h2 id="pivot">Pivot</h2>
        <p>
          <img
            src="https://github.com/JirkaDellOro/FudgeTutorial/assets/101626054/0c155834-644b-4294-b6c5-bbd359c70e49"
            alt="BildComponentAttributesScaled"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Each node and resource has its own point (pivot) in the coordinate
          system. Around this point they can be moved, rotated and scaled.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tip: You can edit the operations via the numerical values, as well
            as via key combinations ((translate(X,Y,Z+Mouse
            move)),(rotate),(scale)) and with the mouse in the graph editor.
          </li>

          Shaders realize surface properties of the 3D object, such as gloss and
          matte, bumps, color and texture. Without shaders we can&#39;t see the
          mesh in the graph at all. FUDGE offers different shaders for different
          use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also load images, graphics or textures externally into the
          project and include them in the shaders. To do this, create a new
          folder in the project, insert an image, bind it to a component and
          then attach it to the mesh.
        </p>

          The scene needs light so that you can see the objects in the browser.
          The editor automatically turns on light when it detects that no light
          exists in the graph.
        </p>
        <div class="FloatClearer"></div>

        <p>
          <img

            alt="BildCreateLight"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let&#39;s give our box a light component. To do this, we select
          the node where the box is and right-click on the Components tab in the
          editor. Then click on addComponents -&gt; LightComponent to add the
          component to the node.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are different types of ComponentLight. Besides the types, you
          can also change the color of the light, as well as the size and
          direction of the light. How the different types behave can be seen in
          the FUDGE wiki.

        <p>
          If you want to move an object with different meshes, you have to move
          each mesh one by one. this is of course tedious. The easy way is to
          attach the nodes as children to a ParentNode and move them with
          ComponentTransform. Create a new node and drag in the nodes you want
          to move together. These will be the children. Then add the
          ComponentTransform component to the ParentNode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you can move, scale and rotate all the children together via the
          parentÂ´s component.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the internal.json file you can see all objects, how they are built,
          which materials they have and how they are connected to each other.
        </p>
        <div class="FloatClearer"></div>

        <h2 id="html-file">HTML-file</h2>
        <p>
          The index.html file is the core of the project. This is where
          everything comes together. In the file you can rename the page, as
          well as edit and view all links
          (internal.json/CustomScript/AutoViewScript). Here it is also helpful
          to pay attention to the comments. For example, if you need physics
          later in the project, it is necessary to uncomment the line afterwards
          so that it is included in the project. The fudge-core and -aid library
          are fetched from the internet in the html file. So if you want to work
          locally, it is necessary to create the library locally and change the
          path in the file. The dialog element is necessary at the start, so
          that audio elements (if you have built them in) can be started and the
          mouse position in the browser can be locked when interacting. So you
          can see this like a kind of &quot;start&quot; button.
        </p>
        <h2 id="autoview-script">Autoview-Script</h2>
        <p>
          The AutoView script allows viewing the graph in the internet browser.
          Since we have not yet set up a camera in the project ourselves, the
          script itself places an orbit camera in the scene, casts the graph
          onto the canvas element in the browser, and thus gives us the ability
          to view our project live. The following keyboard shortcuts are helpful
          for navigating in AutoView:
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Interaction</td>

        <p>
          The script only serves as a kind of &quot;startup&quot;. It displays
          the graph specified in the HTML file, plays the sounds if any exist in
          the scene and adds an orbit camera. It is not recommended to extend
          this script. Instead, use the lines as a template to implement some of
          the functionality in your code, as the script will become obsolete for
          you as the project progresses.

            For further coding, TypeScript is recommended to avoid common errors

          <li>
            <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: The d.ts file in the @types subfolder
            MUST match the current FUDGE version in order for the TypeScript
            compiler to provide you with full support.
          </li>
          <li>
            As the project progresses, other d.ts files may come up to provide
            further assistance(If you want to work with FUDGE-NET, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            the tsconfig file gives instructions to the compiler how to compile
            your written code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Note that all your code ends up in <strong>Script.js</strong> in the
            build folder when compiled.
            <h3 id="main-ts">Main.ts</h3>
            In the script folder of your project there are 2 folders: build and
            source. in build all your compiled code ends up in script.js. In
            this script, for the first time, there is only the warning that you
            always see in the browser console when you start the project.

          In the source folder you will find the tsconfig file, the @types
          folder and 2 .ts files: CustomComponentScript and Main. We will save
          the CustomComponentScript for later. Let&#39;s have a look at Main.ts
          first.

          For now, there is not much in it. How to work with Loop/Update will be
          explained in the following chapters. Let&#39;s first see that we get
          rid of the warning from the console. For this we simply build Main.ts
          the first time via the development environment (VSCode = CTRL+Shift+B
          - npm:build task). After this is done, the Script.js file should look
          like this:

          The loop, also game-loop, is the heart of applications that rely on
          frequent rendering of scenes to create moving visuals. That is not the
          case for all games, but many. The loop dispatches a LOOP_FRAME event
          with every beat to all registered consumers. The desired framerate is
          adjustable and can be based on different time instances. The default
          setup is tying the framerate to the browsers animation-request
          functionality and base the timing on Time.game.

        <p>
          FUDGE supports multiple and scalable times. Mostly used are the built
          in game-time and real-time. Realtime is the time of the system running
          FUDGE and cannot be manipulated. The game-time on the other hand may
          be slowed down or sped up, set or reset. All time dependent
          functionality referring to game-time thus reacts accordingly. Creators
          may define more time-instances as desired. The class Time is a
          fundamental class to use in FUDGE.
