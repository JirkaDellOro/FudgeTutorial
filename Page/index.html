            <p>
              First of all, you need to set up the working environment. Here we
              will show you how to install the FUDGE repository on your
              environment and get the first glimpse of the FUDGE editor.
            </p>
            <h2 id="create-a-github-account">1. create a GitHub account</h2>
            <p>
              this is optional, as you will be able to download the repository
              locally even without an account. Note, however, that upcoming
              changes to the engine will not be applied and you will have to
              manually re-download new versions.
            </p>
            <p>
              A new account can be created

            <p>
              Open the FUDGE repository via Code -&gt; Clone or via GitHub
              Desktop and clone the repository. As mentioned earlier, you can
              simply download the repository as a ZIP locally to your working
              environment.
            </p>
            <h2 id="install-fudge">3. install FUDGE</h2>
            <p>
              In order to install FUDGE, you need to make sure that you have the
              following installed in addition to the local files:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Nodejs</strong> - needed to install FUDGE and get it
                running. Follow the installation procedure at
                <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">https://nodejs.org/en</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>TypeScript</strong> - This is optional, but recommended
                to write custom scripts in FUDGE. To install TypeScript
                globally, type npm install -g typescript in the terminal.
                Alternatively, you can use JavaScript to write the scripts.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once this is done, follow the steps below:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Extract the ZIP file into the desired folder.</li>
              <li>
                Install the needed modules via
                <code>npm install --omit=dev</code> in the terminal in the
                folder where FUDGE is included or just run the
                install.bat(Windows only). If the repository has been cloned,
                you can skip the first step.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="start-editor">4. Start editor</h2>
            <p>to open the FUDGE editor now, you have the following options:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                type electron <code>editor/electron</code> in the terminal
              </li>
              <li>alternatively you can use <code>npm run-script run</code></li>
              <li>use the FUDGE.bat file in the folder (Windows only)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="user-interface">User Interface</h2>

            />
            <p>
              If the installation was completed successfully, you will now see
              an empty window with a browser console.

            Here we will explain the first steps in FUDGE and how everything is
            set up to help you get started with the engine, if there are any
            questions after the tutorial, don&#39;t hesitate to post an issue or
            call for help in Discord in the game lab.
          </p>
          <h2 id="creating-a-new-project">Creating a new project</h2>
          <p>
            To start a new project in FUDGE, go to Project - New , and select
            the folder of your choice. The editor will create all the data you
            need for your project there, as well as make any changes you have
            made to the project.
          </p>
          <h2 id="overview-editor">Overview Editor</h2>
          <img

            alt="BildEditorAufbauExampleScaled"
          />
          <p>
            Once the project is created, you can now open the tabs for editing
            the project. In the Project tab you can create new projects, load
            existing ones and save your current one. In the Edit tab you can see
            all the tabs you can use for your work. These tabs can be closed and
            opened as you like, as well as moved around in the window as you
            like. This allows you to customize your working environment. In the
            debug tab you can open the browser console in case you accidentally
            closed it or show the window in full screen.

            alt="BildLinkTheme"
          />
          <p>
            It is good to know that you can change the theme of the editor as
            you like or even design one yourself. Go to HTML - Fudge.html and
            comment the desired theme or create a new stylesheet and include it
            there.

            <span style="color: red; font-size: 1.8rem">Important!</span> In
            order to detect and monitor errors at an early stage, it is
            advisable to always have the browser console open in the editor as
            well as in the Internet browser. You can also expand the messages of
            Fudge by expanding the messages in the browser console.

            Since the project is stored locally in your folder, you can also
            view them in Explorer. This is where all the resources you need for
            your project are created and stored.
          </p>
          <div class="FloatClearer"></div>

          <p>
            Here you can also add your own images, graphics, models that you may
            need for your project. It is best to create a new folder for
            external data to keep the overview.

          <p>
            The project has been created, but there is no content to view it
            yet. If you want to view your project right now, the internet
            browser will give you the following error message:
          </p>
          <div class="FloatClearer"></div>

          <p>
            <img

          </p>
          <p>
            Now, to see something on the browser, we need to add a graph, mesh
            and material to the project. To do this, right-click on Internal in
            the editor and follow the steps on the following image:
          </p>

          <p>
            If you want to test the project live in the browser or test it on
            other devices, you can do this via
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>LiveServer plugin, which VSC provides.</li>
            <li>localhost</li>
            <li>GitHub Pages, where you upload your project to GitHub.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="json-overview">JSON Overview</h2>

              alt="BildAufbauJSON"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            If you look at the internal.json file on your development
            environment, you will see all the resources that FUDGE has created
            over the course of the project, what attributes they have, and how
            they relate to each other. Here you can see the graph, mesh and
            material you created in the previous step.
          </p>
          <div class="FloatClearer"></div>

          <p>
            For now, the resources are just there. Throughout the tutorial, the
            file will change and expand as we add new objects and connect
            existing ones.
          </p>
          <h2 id="build-a-graph">Build a graph</h2>
          <p>

              alt="BildCreateNodeScaled"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            To view the created resources in the browser, they must first be
            attached to a node. For this, a node must be created in the editor.
            If you drag the graph into the editor, it will create a node itself.
          </p>
          <div class="FloatClearer"></div>

          <p>
            For the remaining components, you have to create a node yourself and
            attach the resources. This can be done by drag&amp;drop. First the
            mesh, then the material. Alternatively, you can create the
            components by right-clicking - add Component -
            ComponentMesh/ComponentMaterial and then attach the desired
            resources from the Internal tab.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each node and resource has its own point (pivot) in the coordinate
            system. Around this point they can be moved, rotated and scaled.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Tip: You can edit the operations via the numerical values, as well
              as via key combinations ((translate(X,Y,Z+Mouse
              move)),(rotate),(scale)) and with the mouse in the graph editor.

          <h2 id="meshes-and-their-parameters">Meshes and their parameters</h2>
          <p>
            FUDGE offers you several meshes that you can use for your project.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              MeshCube - Generates a simple cube with edges of length 1, each
              face consisting of two trigons
            </li>
            <li>
              MeshPolygon - Generates a flat polygon. All trigons share vertex
              0, so careful design is required to create concave polygons.
              Vertex 0 is also associated with the face normal.
            </li>
            <li>
              MeshExtrusion - Generates an extrusion of a polygon by a series of
              transformations
            </li>
            <li>
              MeshPyramid - Generates a simple pyramid with edges at the base of
              length 1 and a height of 1. The sides consisting of one, the base
              of two trigons
            </li>
            <li>
              MeshQuad - Generates a simple quad with edges of length 1, the
              face consisting of two trigons
            </li>
            <li>
              MeshTerrain - A terrain spreads out in the x-z-plane, y is the
              height derived from the heightmap function. The terrain is always
              1 in size in all dimensions,fitting into the unit-cube. Resolution
              determines the number of quads in x and z dimension, scale the
              factor applied to the x,z-coordinates passed to the heightmap
              function. Standard function is the simplex noise implemented with
              FUDGE, but another function can be given.
            </li>
            <li>
              MeshRelief - Generates a planar Grid and applies a
              Heightmap-Function to it.
            </li>
            <li>
              MeshRotation - Generates a rotation of a polygon around the y-axis
            </li>
            <li>
              MeshSphere - Generate a UV Sphere with a given number of sectors
              and stacks (clamped at 128*128)
            </li>
            <li>
              MeshSprite - Generate two quads placed back to back, the one
              facing in negative Z-direction is textured reversed
            </li>
            <li>
              MeshTorus - Generate a Torus with a given thickness and the number
              of major- and minor segments
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Shaders realize surface properties of the 3D object, such as gloss
            and matte, bumps, color and texture. Without shaders we can&#39;t
            see the mesh in the graph at all. FUDGE offers different shaders for
            different use cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also load images, graphics or textures externally into the
            project and include them in the shaders. To do this, create a new
            folder in the project, insert an image, bind it to a component and
            then attach it to the mesh.

            The scene needs light so that you can see the objects in the
            browser. The editor automatically turns on light when it detects
            that no light exists in the graph.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now let&#39;s give our box a light component. To do this, we select
            the node where the box is and right-click on the Components tab in
            the editor. Then click on addComponents -&gt; LightComponent to add
            the component to the node.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            There are different types of ComponentLight. Besides the types, you
            can also change the color of the light, as well as the size and
            direction of the light. How the different types behave can be seen
            in the FUDGE wiki.

          <p>
            If you want to move an object with different meshes, you have to
            move each mesh one by one. this is of course tedious. The easy way
            is to attach the nodes as children to a ParentNode and move them
            with ComponentTransform. Create a new node and drag in the nodes you
            want to move together. These will be the children. Then add the
            ComponentTransform component to the ParentNode.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now you can move, scale and rotate all the children together via the
            parent´s component.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the internal.json file you can see all objects, how they are
            built, which materials they have and how they are connected to each
            other.
          </p>

          <h2 id="html-file">HTML-file</h2>
          <p>
            The index.html file is the core of the project. This is where
            everything comes together. In the file you can rename the page, as
            well as edit and view all links
            (internal.json/CustomScript/AutoViewScript). Here it is also helpful
            to pay attention to the comments. For example, if you need physics
            later in the project, it is necessary to uncomment the line
            afterwards so that it is included in the project. The fudge-core and
            -aid library are fetched from the internet in the html file. So if
            you want to work locally, it is necessary to create the library
            locally and change the path in the file. The dialog element is
            necessary at the start, so that audio elements (if you have built
            them in) can be started and the mouse position in the browser can be
            locked when interacting. So you can see this like a kind of
            &quot;start&quot; button.
          </p>
          <h2 id="autoview-script">Autoview-Script</h2>
          <p>
            The AutoView script allows viewing the graph in the internet
            browser. Since we have not yet set up a camera in the project
            ourselves, the script itself places an orbit camera in the scene,
            casts the graph onto the canvas element in the browser, and thus
            gives us the ability to view our project live. The following
            keyboard shortcuts are helpful for navigating in AutoView: |
            Interaction | Function | |
            ----------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------:|
            | left click | setting the point of rotation | | alt + left click |
            change viewing direction from point of rotation | | right
            click+mouse movement/right click(+shift)+Q/E/A/D | change viewing
            direction from Camera viewpoint | | mouse wheel/right click+W/S |
            zoom in/out | | alt + right click + mousemovement | zoom in/out |
          </p>

          <p>
            The script only serves as a kind of &quot;startup&quot;. It displays
            the graph specified in the HTML file, plays the sounds if any exist
            in the scene and adds an orbit camera. It is not recommended to
            extend this script. Instead, use the lines as a template to
            implement some of the functionality in your code, as the script will
            become obsolete for you as the project progresses.

            <li>
              For further coding, TypeScript is recommended to avoid common
              errors that happen with pure JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: The d.ts file in the @types subfolder
              MUST match the current FUDGE version in order for the TypeScript
              compiler to provide you with full support.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the project progresses, other d.ts files may come up to provide
              further assistance(If you want to work with FUDGE-NET, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
              the tsconfig file gives instructions to the compiler how to
              compile your written code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Note that all your code ends up in <strong>Script.js</strong> in
              the build folder when compiled.
              <h3 id="main-ts">Main.ts</h3>
              In the script folder of your project there are 2 folders: build
              and source. in build all your compiled code ends up in script.js.
              In this script, for the first time, there is only the warning that
              you always see in the browser console when you start the project.
            </li>
          </ul>

            In the source folder you will find the tsconfig file, the @types
            folder and 2 .ts files: CustomComponentScript and Main. We will save
            the CustomComponentScript for later. Let&#39;s have a look at
            Main.ts first.

            For now, there is not much in it. How to work with Loop/Update will
            be explained in the following chapters. Let&#39;s first see that we
            get rid of the warning from the console. For this we simply build
            Main.ts the first time via the development environment (VSCode =
            CTRL+Shift+B - npm:build task). After this is done, the Script.js
            file should look like this:

          <h2 id="loop">Loop</h2>
          <p>
            The loop, also game-loop, is the heart of applications that rely on
            frequent rendering of scenes to create moving visuals. That is not
            the case for all games, but many. The loop dispatches a LOOP_FRAME
            event with every beat to all registered consumers. The desired
            framerate is adjustable and can be based on different time
            instances. The default setup is tying the framerate to the browsers
            animation-request functionality and base the timing on Time.game.

          <p>
            FUDGE supports multiple and scalable times. Mostly used are the
            built in game-time and real-time. Realtime is the time of the system
            running FUDGE and cannot be manipulated. The game-time on the other
            hand may be slowed down or sped up, set or reset. All time dependent
            functionality referring to game-time thus reacts accordingly.
            Creators may define more time-instances as desired. The class Time
            is a fundamental class to use in FUDGE.
